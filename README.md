# ShareBnB 

A full stack web application for people to share and rent out their private and public spaces with others. Users create listings that include photos, location, price, # of beds, # of rooms, etc. and are able to search for created listings by price, location, # of beds, and # of bathrooms, etc. Users book listings and message other users regarding a listing, directly on the platform.  

Check out the deployed app <a href="">here</a>.

Note: the following documentation focuses on the frontend. For backend related documentation and commentary, please go <a href="">here</a> 

## Motivation

As we move towards a world where people share more and more things, it’s time we build an application where users can share indoor and outdoor spaces like backyards or pools!
